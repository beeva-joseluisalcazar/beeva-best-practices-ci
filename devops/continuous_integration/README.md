# Continuous Integration

Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of continuously integrating (and testing) new code with your existing source code, merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

It aims to avoid integration problems and deliver the software often, but with the security it will work, so it's based in "maximum automation".

## Objectives

This document aims at make a complete description of the continuous integration system used in BEEVA projects.

Using CI we will be able to keep a making sure the software checked in on the mainline is always in a state that can be deployed. 
Test, support, development and operations work together as one delivery team to automate and streamline the build, test and release process.

Continuous Delivery is the natural extension of Continuous Integration: an approach in which teams ensure that every change to the system is releasable, and that we can release any version at the push of a button.

To help in this work, there are a variety of tools available like Jenkins, Apache Continuum or Bamboo.



## Architecture, technologies and tools


### Jenkins

Jenkins is an continuous integration and continuous delivery application that increases your productivity allowing to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build.

#### How Jenkins work

Jenkins needs an installed Tomcat versiÃ³n 5.0 or later.
Jenkins requires Java7 or above to function. Java8 is recommended. Jenkins requires a fair amount of memory to operate well. Smaller installations should start around 256MB-1GB.

In the next picture you can see the list of jobs ready to be executed in a jenkins instance.

#### Configuration

### SVN

### Git/Github

### Maven

Jenkins distributions contain, by default, a Maven Project plugin version to allow running Maven projects. This plugin must be first set up to use a local Maven installation. If there's no local installation, we can select and download a version directly from the configuration section (Manage Jenkins -> Configure system):

![Maven plugin configuration](static/jenkins_maven_config.png)

Once Maven plugin is ready, Maven projects can be run on Jenkins in two different ways:

1.- Running a "Maven task" step in any kind of job:

![Maven task step in a generic job](static/jenkins_maven_step.png)

This way is useful when several independent Maven projects will run in the same job.

2.- Creating a "Maven project" job:

This kind of job allows to easily configure some maven-oriented enhancenments in order to automate continuous integration between different projects:

	* Maven jobs can be configured to be triggered when any of its snapshot dependencies is built on the same Jenkins. This is achieved by parsing the POMs.

	* Build stage can be deeply customized without changing POMs files. Some interesting Maven options can be configured by checking/unchecking them.
![Maven job Build options](static/jenkins_maven_job_build_options.png)

	* A helpful post-build action is also available: we can automatically upload artifacts to Maven repositories once the build is done.

At least, we can check the quality of a Maven project by simply checking the historical graph, which provides a visual report.



### Sonar

### Selenium

### Dimensions

Dimensions CM is a tool developed by Serena that provides capabilities for managing the whole lifecycle of a project: revision control, change, build and release management ([more info](http://www.serena.com/index.php/en/products/application-development/dimensions-cm/overview/)).

Thanks to this [unofficial plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Dimensions+Plugin), Jenkins can connect to Dimensions to:
* Download code from streams, projects and baselines.
* Deliver content into Dimensions streams and projects and relate the changes to a PIMP.
* Create baselines from streams and projects.


### Bamboo

Bamboo is a continuous integration and delivery tool that ties automated builds, tests and releases together in a single workflow, it integrates perfectly with Jira ( a the project management tool for agile teams, both are atlassian products)

If connecting with Bitbucket and JIRA Software, details like JIRA issues, commits, reviews and approvals follow each release of your application from development to production.
