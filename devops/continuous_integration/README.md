# Continuous Integration

Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.
It aims to avoid integration problems 

Using CI we will be able to keep a making sure the software checked in on the mainline is always in a state that can be deployed. 

To help in this work, there are a variety of tools available like Jenkins.
